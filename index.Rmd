---

#Preface {-}

It is important to us that the read has accessible resources that can support their learning when using the *Loss Data Analytics* book. This *Summary of Distributions* aims to assist readers by providing them with distributions used commonly throughout the book. The distributions detailed in this resource represent all of the distributions from the Exam C tables as well as a few other commonly used distributions. In addition to this, each distribution has been graphed and its corresponding density, distribution, quantile, and random function in `R`.
